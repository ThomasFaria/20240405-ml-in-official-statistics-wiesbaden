## Introduction

- Data scientists @ Insee's labs

- Like most NSOs, increasing use of big data sources and ML methods @ Insee

- Much work on the methological side, but not much to formalize what a modern data science infrastructure for official statistics should look like 

## Challenges

- Limited resources of traditional IT infrastructures

- Availability of flexible and scalable development environments

- The "wall of production"

## Autonomy is all you need

- In the era of data science, IT must be a means of autonomization, not a constraint

- Onyxia : making cloud technologies accessible to statisticians
  - Reference platform for the one-stop-shop (AIML4OS WP3)

- Goal of this talk : "retour d'exp√©rience"
  - How we devised Onyxia's principles 
  - How it was instrumental in putting ML in production at Insee

## Discussion

- Autonomy has a price
  - Large entry costs of cloud technologies for organizations
  - Statisticians must adopt new development practices

## Conclusion

- In the era of data science, methodology and IT must come forward together
